# kmeans
the project implements a clustering algorithm based on symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF). It further applies this algorithm to various datasets and compares it to K-means. The README provides details about the algorithm, code structure, and requirements.

Files:

symnmf.py: Python interface of the SymNMF algorithm.

symnmf.c: C implementation of the SymNMF algorithm.

symnmfmodule.c: Python C API wrapper.

symnmf.h: C header file.

analysis.py: Script to compare SymNMF and K-means.

setup.py: Setup file for building the C extension.

Makefile: Make script for the C implementation.

kmeans.py: The kmeans algorithm implementation from assignment 1.**
